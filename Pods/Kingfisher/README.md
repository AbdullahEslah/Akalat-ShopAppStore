### Kingfisher 101
>>>>>>> 8c67f71eb814d2079ee60232badaef74c4c83c67

The simplest use-case is setting an image to an image view with the `UIImageView` extension:

```swift
<<<<<<< HEAD
let url = URL(string: "url_of_your_image")
imageView.kf.setImage(with: url)
```

Kingfisher will download the image from `url`, send it to both the memory cache and the disk cache, and display it in `imageView`. When you use the same code later, the image will be retrieved from cache and shown immediately.

For more examples of using Kingfisher, take a look at the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet).

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / macOS 10.10+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 2.0+
- Swift 4 (Kingfisher 4.x), Swift 3 (Kingfisher 3.x)

Main development of Kingfisher is based on Swift 4. Only critical bug fixes will be applied to Kingfisher 3.x.

- Kingfisher 4.0 Migration - Kingfisher 3.x should be source compatible to Kingfisher 4. The reason for a major update is that we need to specify the Swift version explicitly for Xcode. All deprecated methods in Kingfisher 3 has been removed, so please ensure you have no warning left before you migrate from Kingfisher 3 to Kingfisher 4. If you have any trouble in migrating, please open an issue to discuss.
- [Kingfisher 3.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Kingfisher-3.0-Migration-Guide) - If you are upgrading to Kingfisher 3.x from an earlier version, please read this for more information.

### Future of Kingfisher

I want to keep Kingfisher lightweight. This framework will focus on providing a simple solution for downloading and caching images. This doesn‚Äôt mean the framework can‚Äôt be improved. Kingfisher is far from perfect, so necessary and useful updates will be made to make it better.

### Developments and Tests

Any contributing and pull requests are warmly welcome. However, before you plan to implement some features or try to fix an uncertain issue, it is recommended to open a discussion first. 

The test images are contained in another project to keep this project repo fast and slim. You could run `./setup.sh` in the root folder of Kingfisher to clone the test images when you need to run the tests target. It would be appreciated if your pull requests could build and with all tests green. :)

### About the logo

The logo of Kingfisher is inspired by [Tangram (‰∏ÉÂ∑ßÊùø)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram), a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes from China. I believe she's a kingfisher bird instead of a swift, but someone insists that she is a pigeon. I guess I should give her a name. Hi, guys, do you have any suggestions?

=======
import Kingfisher

let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/image.png")
imageView.kf.setImage(with: url)
```

Kingfisher will download the image from `url`, send it to both memory cache and disk cache, and display it in `imageView`. 
When you set with the same URL later, the image will be retrieved from the cache and shown immediately.

It also works if you use SwiftUI:

```swift
var body: some View {
    KFImage(URL(string: "https://example.com/image.png")!)
}
```

### A More Advanced Example

With the powerful options, you can do hard tasks with Kingfisher in a simple way. For example, the code below: 

1. Downloads a high-resolution image.
2. Downsamples it to match the image view size.
3. Makes it round cornered with a given radius.
4. Shows a system indicator and a placeholder image while downloading.
5. When prepared, it animates the small thumbnail image with a "fade in" effect. 
6. The original large image is also cached to disk for later use, to get rid of downloading it again in a detail view.
7. A console log is printed when the task finishes, either for success or failure.

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/high_resolution_image.png")
let processor = DownsamplingImageProcessor(size: imageView.bounds.size)
             |> RoundCornerImageProcessor(cornerRadius: 20)
imageView.kf.indicatorType = .activity
imageView.kf.setImage(
    with: url,
    placeholder: UIImage(named: "placeholderImage"),
    options: [
        .processor(processor),
        .scaleFactor(UIScreen.main.scale),
        .transition(.fade(1)),
        .cacheOriginalImage
    ])
{
    result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let value):
        print("Task done for: \(value.source.url?.absoluteString ?? "")")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Job failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

It is a common situation I can meet in my daily work. Think about how many lines you need to write without
Kingfisher!

### Method Chaining

If you are not a fan of the `kf` extension, you can also prefer to use the `KF` builder and chained the method 
invocations. The code below is doing the same thing:

```swift
// Use `kf` extension
imageView.kf.setImage(
    with: url,
    placeholder: placeholderImage,
    options: [
        .processor(processor),
        .loadDiskFileSynchronously,
        .cacheOriginalImage,
        .transition(.fade(0.25)),
        .lowDataMode(.network(lowResolutionURL))
    ],
    progressBlock: { receivedSize, totalSize in
        // Progress updated
    },
    completionHandler: { result in
        // Done
    }
)

// Use `KF` builder
KF.url(url)
  .placeholder(placeholderImage)
  .setProcessor(processor)
  .loadDiskFileSynchronously()
  .cacheMemoryOnly()
  .fade(duration: 0.25)
  .lowDataModeSource(.network(lowResolutionURL))
  .onProgress { receivedSize, totalSize in  }
  .onSuccess { result in  }
  .onFailure { error in }
  .set(to: imageView)
```

And even better, if later you want to switch to SwiftUI, just change the `KF` above to `KFImage`, and you've done:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        KFImage.url(url)
          .placeholder(placeholderImage)
          .setProcessor(processor)
          .loadDiskFileSynchronously()
          .cacheMemoryOnly()
          .fade(duration: 0.25)
          .lowDataModeSource(.network(lowResolutionURL))
          .onProgress { receivedSize, totalSize in  }
          .onSuccess { result in  }
          .onFailure { error in }
    }
}
```

### Learn More

To learn the use of Kingfisher by more examples, take a look at the well-prepared [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet). T
here we summarized the most common tasks in Kingfisher, you can get a better idea of what this framework can do. 
There are also some performance tips, remember to check them too.

- iOS 12.0+ / macOS 10.14+ / tvOS 12.0+ / watchOS 5.0+ (if you use only UIKit/AppKit)
- iOS 14.0+ / macOS 11.0+ / tvOS 14.0+ / watchOS 7.0+ (if you use it in SwiftUI)
- Swift 5.0+

> If you need to support from iOS 10 (UIKit/AppKit) or iOS 13 (SwiftUI), use Kingfisher version 6.x. But it won't work 
> with Xcode 13 [#1802](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1802).
>
> If you need to use Xcode 13 but cannot upgrade to v7, use the `version6-xcode13` branch. However, you have to drop 
> iOS 10 support due to an Xcode 13 bug.
